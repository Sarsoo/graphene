@article{graphene-high-temp,
	abstract = {Heat has always been a killing matter for traditional semiconductor machines. The underlining physical reason is that the intrinsic carrier density of a device made from a traditional semiconductor material increases very fast with a rising temperature. Once reaching a temperature, the density surpasses the chemical doping or gating effect, any p-n junction or transistor made from the semiconductor will fail to function. Here, we measure the intrinsic Fermi level (|EF| = 2.93 kBT) or intrinsic carrier density (nin = 3.87 {\texttimes} 10(6) cm(-2)K(-2){\textcdot} T(2)), carrier drift velocity, and G mode phonon energy of graphene devices and their temperature dependencies up to 2400 K. Our results show intrinsic carrier density of graphene is an order of magnitude less sensitive to temperature than those of Si or Ge, and reveal the great potentials of graphene as a material for high temperature devices. We also observe a linear decline of saturation drift velocity with increasing temperature, and identify the temperature coefficients of the intrinsic G mode phonon energy. Above knowledge is vital in understanding the physical phenomena of graphene under high power or high temperature.},

@article{graphene-review-2010,
	abstract = {Graphene has changed from being the exclusive domain of condensed-matter physicists to being explored by those in the electron-device community. In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges.},

The line-edge roughness is modeled in edge-enhanced band-to-band-tunneling and localization regimes, and then verified for various roughness amplitudes. Corresponding to these two regimes, the off-current is initially increased, then decreased; while, on the other hand, the on-current is continuously decreased by increasing the roughness amplitude.},

@article{gnrfet-applications,
	abstract = {The dimension down scaling capability of the silicon based transistors has produced significant developments in the electronic industry. The channel length reduction has been accompanied by many limitations and challenges in the performance of the transistor. According to the ITRS and Moore law silicon based technology is near to its end, consequently the novel material innovations are needed in the near future. The graphene based material is the promising candidate for silicon channel replacement in conventional transistor. In this paper, graphene, graphene nanoribbons and their fundamental properties such as mechanical, electrical and electronic specifications are introduced. Then, graphene nanoribbon field effect transistor and its modeling and simulation methods are investigated. The best method for device simulation is the self-consistent solving of Poisson and Schr{\"o}dinger equations under non-equilibrium green's function with the tight binding approximation. In order to investigate the effect of down scaling on the transistor performance, parameters such as drain induced barrier lowering, sub-threshold swing, ION/IOFFratio, and transconductance are studied. Moreover, utilizations of the graphene nanoribbon field effect transistor including circuit-based, high frequency, and biosensors applications are introduced. The results show that graphene based transistors are an excellent replacement to silicon based transistors.},
