\begin_layout Abstract
Graphene has many desirable mechanical and electrical characteristics that
 make it an exciting material for use in innovative devices.
 In particular, its extremely high carrier mobility leads to high operating
 frequencies that potentially make the material suitable for the gigahertz
 and terahertz spectrum.
 The use of graphene for high-frequency electronics applications is considered,
 firstly as a channel material for digital logic transistor technology with
 a focus on graphene nanoribbon FETs (GNRFET).
 Graphene's applicability is then evaluated for flexible antennae with prospecti
ve use in wearable and IoT devices.
 Part two models graphene's sheet conductivity, exploring how net carrier
 concentration, temperature and scatter lifetime affect both intraband and
 interband electrical characteristics.

Graphene is a 2D allotrope of carbon with highly interesting mechanical
 and electrical properties that have made it a popular target of research
 over the last two decades since its experimental discovery in 2004

 Resembling a honeycomb structure, each carbon atoms bonds to three surrounding
 atoms by overlapping

-orbitals.
 This leaves one remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

.
 As a result, graphene has a 0 energy bandgap, the conduction and valence
 band meet at a single point known as the Dirac point at the K points in
 momentum space.
 Both bands linearly extend away from the Dirac point, a highly unusual
 result that allows electrons to act as massless Fermions which move with
 extremely high mobility, as high as 200,000 cm

This section explores two uses of graphene for high-frequency applications.
 First, the applicability of graphene for field-effect transistors will
 be considered as a channel material.
 Throughout, a particular focus will be paid to use in digital logic and
 thus as a possible replacement for the current Silicon CMOS/MOSFET paradigm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following its prospective use in digital logic, graphene's applicability
 as a flexible antennae material will be considered.
 As the space of wearable and bio-electronics develop, the need for strong,
 flexible and efficient antennae at gigahertz frequencies is clear.
 Existing flexible antennae technology will be considered before presenting
 how graphene could be included.

Digital Logic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Silicon-based CMOS/MOSFET digital logic is the basis on which much of the
 modern electronics landscape has been built.
 From integrated logic circuits to CPUs, it is hard to overstate how important
 this technology has proven to be.
 The need for more powerful devices has increased pressure for smaller and
 more efficient transistors, such that more can fit into a single device.
 This progress is typically described by Moore's Law and can be seen graphically
 in figure

However, as transistors are made smaller, theoretical limits for many engineerin

 In 2015, the ITRS predicted that by 2021 the current push for smaller transisto

 structures would be required

 Some of the most important limiting factors in the current Silicon landscape
 are short-channel effects, a group of undesirable electrical properties
 that can occur when the channel length of a MOSFET device is of the same
 order of magnitude as the depletion layer

As previously covered, a sheet of graphene or 
\emph on
large-area graphene
\emph default
 has no bandgap.
 As such it is unable to turn off, making it unsuitable as a channel material
 for a digital MOSFET.
 Quantitatively, this can be measured with the ratio of on current to off
 current or the 
\emph on
on/off ratio
\emph default
.
 Existing Silicon CMOS can expect an on/off ratio of at least the order
 of 10

Therefore, it is clear that to use graphene as a channel material a bandgap
 must be formed.
 There are a number of ways to do so, a selection of band diagrams for such
 structures can be seen in figure

 For digital applications, one of the most promising methods for creating
 a bandgap is by confining graphene in one dimension to create a

graphene nanoribbon

 (GNR).
 In doing so it has been shown that the produced bandgap is inversely proportion
al to the width of this ribbon

 Edge roughness can significantly affect the properties of the channel,

 both pristine graphene and the existing silicon technology.
 A rough edge also increases delay and leakage power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, one of the major constraints of GNRFET technology is limited mobility.
 Although graphene has incredibly high carrier mobility, by opening the
 bandgap as seen in figure

 This increases the carrier's effective mass, significantly reducing mobility.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these applications, it is clear that graphene has the potential to
 revolutionise cutting-edge electronics domains including high-performance,
 high-efficiency transistor technologies and the wearable/IoT devices.
 Although the material does not yet have significant penetration in consumer
 electronics, it is likely that this is not far away.

 Beyond the cutoff frequency, the value is around 1 mS by 10 THz.

 the imaginary component begins to peak, the phase increases to a max of
 90 degrees, continuing until 100 THz where the phase sharply drops to -90
 degrees.
 There is little difference between the two dopants, particularly prior
 to 100 THz.
 Following this, the TTF shows a -100 THz offset from the CoCp

 Comparing the two, it can be seen that the interactions happen over largely
 separate frequency ranges.
 In general, the intraband conductivity can be seen to exist up to the 10
 THz portion of the spectrum while the interband has the majority of its
 contributions above the 10 THz range.
 The intraband can be seen to dominate the total conductivity, it is largely
 invisible in the previous combined view of figure

 Beyond this threshold, the conductivity below 10 THz begins to increase
 exponentially.
 Above 100 THz, an opposite trend can be identified with areas of the surface
 showing a lower value.
 From the high frequency, high carrier smear visible in the surface, the
 spectral behaviour of this lowering conductivity is not static but a function
 of both frequency and carrier concentration.

The interband conductivity can be seen to show more variation over the prescribe
d carrier concentration range.
 Low carrier concentrations result in a high initial imaginary component
 that does not descend into negative values.
 As concentration increases, the imaginary component decreases more with
 a sharper gradient, forming a sharp trough that also reaches its lowest
 value at a higher frequency.
\end_layout

Alongside this imaginary decrease, the real component can be seen to increase
 from a value between 1

 From these, it is clear that the dopant concentration has a significant
 effect on the conductivity's phase in the terahertz spectrum.
 As the carrier concentration is increased, the phase can be seen to increase
 to 90 degrees for longer throughout the 10 GHz decade and begin dropping
 into negative phase.
 From figure

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Looking to the imaginary component, the peak conductivity increases by roughly
 15 mS.
 More variation occurs at the higher frequency, THz conductivity.
 The sharper colour gradient at lower temperatures become more gradual at
 higher temperatures, this indicates that the intraband imaginary negative
 peak takes place over a more gradual spectral range.
 Looking to the low temperature behaviour, the imaginary component is less
 stable, rapidly descending to 0 S by 3 K before the the characteristic
 negative 0.6 mS 200 THz peak returns at 0 K.

 presents the decomposed intraband and interband conductivity contributions
 for three different temperatures, 10 K, 300 K and 2230 K in order to compare
 low, room and high temperatures.
 For intraband conductivity, temperature can be seen to have little effect
 throughout the inspected thermal range.
 The low and room temperature series' effectively overlap, while moving
 to the upper-temperature limit increases the conductivity by only 5 mS
 or 10%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the interband interactions, as the temperature increases, the negative
 imaginary peak gets smaller in value with a smoother gradient.
 For the real component, although the final value does not change, the gradient
 with which it is approached changes.
 At low temperatures, the increase takes place over a tight spectral range
 with a sharp step action.
 As the temperature increases, the spectral band over which the transition
 occurs broadens with a smoother gradient while maintaining the centre frequency
 of 200 THz.
 Overall, considering the complex magnitude for interband interactions,
 little variation can be seen throughout the prescribed temperature range.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the real component, the scatter lifetime can be seen to affect
 both the cutoff frequency and the magnitude of the pre-cutoff value.
 As the lifetime increases, the cutoff frequency occurs at a lower value,
 from around 500 GHz to 50 GHz.
 The magnitude of the conductivity also increases exponentially as the lifetime
 is increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the imaginary component, somewhat similar behaviour can be seen.
 The same exponential growth in magnitude can be seen in the 100 GHz peak.
 With regards to the spectral behaviour, increasing scatter lifetime reduces
 the frequency of the leading edge of the peak, broadening the bandwidth.

 Following the observation that the interband conductivity is unaffected
 by scatter lifetime, it follows that the high-frequency phase is also unchanged
 across the selected lifetimes.
 the phase is affected in the lower gigahertz ranges, however, with a longer
 lifetime being associated with an earlier rising edge in the spectrum and
 a longer bandwidth of 90-degree phase.

 From the simulated data from the literature, the gigahertz cutoff for intraband
 conductivity can be seen to have an associated phase increase.
 This suggests an increase in inductive reactance throughout this spectral
 range which would have implications for applications employing graphene
 at these frequencies and could suggest an increase in delay.
 N-type doped material can be seen to show a negative phase peak at terahertz
 frequencies indicating capacitive behaviour over this spectrum.

As discussed, the interband conductivity is restricted to the higher–energy
 terahertz portion of the spectrum than the lower energy intraband interactions.

With a non-zero Fermi level offset from the Dirac point, resistance drops

When considering n-type doping, the Fermi level is increased from the Dirac
 point.
 As it does, the energy states between it and the Dirac point are filled
 and thus are unavailable for electrons to transition into.
 As interband conductivity involve transitions from the valence band or
 lower Dirac cone to the conduction band or upper cone (when considering
 n-type doping), in order for an electron to make a direct transition without
 momentum change (straight up on a energy-momentum diagram) it must absorb
 at least two times the Fermi level energy in order for the destination
 to be an empty state.
 This restriction, more formally that incident photons of angular frequency,

\begin_layout Standard
From the presented trends it is clear both that graphene must be heavily
 doped in order to obtain significant gigahertz conductivity and that, more
 generally, varying the dopant concentration provides a highly-tunable method
 of altering graphene's electrical characteristics.
 This has particular implications for terahertz applications when considering
 the phase information.
 As presented, the conductivity's complex phase can be shifted in frequency
 and magnitude in the terahertz spectrum by varying the net carrier concentratio
n.
 The phase can also be kept positive at terahertz frequencies with a lower
 carrier concentration, although this severely limits the conductivity magnitude.
 This flexibility in reactive electrical characteristics could prove applicable
 to high-frequency applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conductivity spectrum as a function of temperature shows promising results
 for the electrical stability of graphene over a wide thermal operating
 range.
 The intraband conductivity, specifically, showed little variation in behaviour
 between 10 K and the highest stable temperatures with the previously reported
 10% increase.
 Looking at the interband interactions, these results showed the opposite
 trend with the magnitude being decreased as the temperature increased.
 This would suggest that graphene could prove useful in high-temperature
 devices with special consideration being needed for terahertz applications
 where the phase can be more variable around the critical frequency.

 Similarly to this function, a decreasing temperature increases the gradient
 of this transition between two quasi-constant values, tending towards a
 single step action as the temperature approaches 0 K.

 restriction.
 The higher energy of the electrons associated with their temperature reduces
 the extra required energy to make the transition.
 From figure

 this can be seen in two aspects of the real conductivity.
 Throughout the gigahertz spectrum, the higher temperature blue line has
 a higher constant value than the others.
 This higher conductivity is associated with the slightly lower energy required
 to make an interband transition as a result of the electron's higher energies.
 Additionally, as the critical temperature is approached, the higher temperature
 series begins smoothly rising earlier than the lower temperature series'.
 These behaviours are a result of the statistical distribution of both the
 temperature of the electrons and the energy of the incident photons.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Scatter Lifetime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the presented trends for how conductivity is affected by a varied carrier
 scatter lifetime, it is clear that it has a significant effect on both
 the magnitude and spectral behaviour of intraband conductivity.
 A longer scatter lifetime was shown to increase the magnitude of gigahertz
 conductivity, this can be justified by considering the meaning of the scatter
 lifetime using the Drude model of charge transport.
 The scatter lifetime is the average lifetime between collisions, more collision
s reduce the overall mobility of the material.
 A longer lifetime suggests that electrons are able to travel for longer
 distances at higher speed without being slowed by scatter events, this
 explains the higher magnitude throughout the gigahertz spectrum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interband interactions were seen to be unaffected by the scatter lifetime.
 This can be seen from the model where, unlike equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:inter-conductivity"
plural "false"

 has no reference to a lifetime term.
 As a higher energy interaction, electrons are less affected by the scattering
 of atoms and thus scatter lifetime is not employed for these high-frequency
 transitions.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two applications of graphene at high frequencies have been presented.
 The use of graphene nanoribbons as a channel material for FET technology
 was shown to be a suitable prospective material for challenging the current
 silicon CMOS/MOSFET paradigm as short-channel effects become harder to
 engineer around.
 Following this, graphene's applicability to flexible antennae was evaluated.
 With a less established consumer domain, graphene's bio-compatibility,
 flexibility, stiffness and electrical properties could overtake the more
 limited metal-based ink approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sheet conductivity of graphene was modelled and the effect of varying
 carrier concentration, temperature and scatter lifetime was evaluated.
 Carrier concentration was seen to have a significant effect on conductivity
 as a result of its relation to the materials Fermi level.
 Temperature, however, was shown to have little effect, a promising result
 for the stability of graphene over a wide thermal operating range.
 Scatter lifetime was also shown to have a significant effect on intraband
 conductivity as a result of its importance in the Drude modelling of carrier
 transport.
